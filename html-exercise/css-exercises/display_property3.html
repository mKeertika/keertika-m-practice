<p>
    I have a dream that one day on the red hills of
    Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of
    former slave owners will be able to sit down
    together at the table of brotherhood.
    I have a dream that one day even the state
    of Mississippi, <span>a state sweltering with
        the heat of injustice, sweltering with the
        heat of oppression will be transformed</span>
    into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have
    a dream that my four little
    children will one day live in a nation
    where they will not be judged by the
    color of their skin but by the content
    of their character. I have a dream today.
