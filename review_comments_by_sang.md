# Review comments by Sang

We are going to use this as a basis for
weekly 1-1.

## April 12 (Wednesday)
- "employee" app Part #1 is not finished

## April 13 (Wednesday)
- .gitignore file is added by sang
- "employee-app"
    - part #2 is done successfully
    - "Employee", "HourlyEmployee", "SalariedEmployee" classes are in the wrong package (minor)

## April 17 (Monday)
- "employee_app" is done up to part 5
- Usage of enhanced for-loop in the Department
  class would have been nicer since now you
  are using ArrayList not array

## April 18th (Tuesday morning)
- no "sba_exercise" work is checked in yet
